## Overview
This project focuses on various image processing techniques implemented in MATLAB. It includes operations such as morphological contour detection, Hough transform for detecting lines and circles, image brightness adjustment, spatial and frequency filtering, and histogram operations.

## Features
- **Morphological Contour Detection**: Detects contours in images using morphological operations like dilation and erosion.
